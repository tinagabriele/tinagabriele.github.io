        <p class="welcome-message">I'll preface this by saying that nothing on this page is not already available on the internet. If you have stumbled across this page and you are not a recruiter, well, here's my story. In reverse chronological order, you'll see some key highlights that bring out my experience and who I am in a more consumable way. The intent is to give a better glimpse as to who I am, in ways that a plain old resume could never convey.</p>
